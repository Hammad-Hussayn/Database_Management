 Dear reader,

The goal of this assignment is to encapsulate our PostgreSQL database using Python, and we have made our best effort to achieve this. 
This research enhances the understanding of movie studios, distributors or marketers about when to release a movie in reality. An analysis of the impact that release dates have on financial performances and critics reviews can clinch a cycle for developers in how they schedule their new releases, improve on marketing strategies and above all greatly help reduce production costs. Moreover, they make a significant contribution to the academic literature as well: There is still little evidence on temporal effects in the film industry. 

The conducted research followed the objectives below:

- To analyze the impact of movie release dates on domestic box office revenue. 

- To identify the months that generate the highest average box office returns. 

- To assess the effect of holiday season releases on opening weekend performance. 

- To examine the relationship between user review scores and box office revenue across different release periods.
