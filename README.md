 Dear reader,

The goal of this assignment is to encapsulate our PostgreSQL database using Python, and we have made our best effort to achieve this. 
This research enhances the understanding of movie studios, distributors or marketers about when to release a movie in reality. An analysis of the impact that release dates have on financial performances and critics reviews can clinch a cycle for developers in how they schedule their new releases, improve on marketing strategies and above all greatly help reduce production costs. Moreover, they make a significant contribution to the academic literature as well: There is still little evidence on temporal effects in the film industry. 

The conducted research followed the objectives below:

- To analyze the impact of movie release dates on domestic box office revenue. 

- To identify the months that generate the highest average box office returns. 

- To assess the effect of holiday season releases on opening weekend performance. 

- To examine the relationship between user review scores and box office revenue across different release periods. 

RESEARCH QUESTION 1
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aacf68ee-3758-4715-ad2c-94392677ed5a): Conclusion: this shows that December during the peak period of 21-30th generates the most average domestic box office revenue.
RESEARCH QUESTION 2 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/388a2a5f-ea8d-4246-ab66-c1a202772999): Conclusion: The data suggests that February, the Non-Peak Season, and December are relatively strong periods for opening weekend revenue, while October may not be as lucrative for movie releases. Studios might consider avoiding October or using stronger marketing strategies to boost performance during this period.
RESEARCH QUESTION 3
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/939fb9ae-69df-409b-9816-0c748e0edeb0): Conclusion: The data suggests that UserScore alone does not strongly predict Domestic Box Office revenue. Other factors beyond audience ratings likely play a more significant role in determining box office performance.
RESEARCH QUESTION 4 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b9150c9-0670-48dc-b07f-c5ff77aca152): Conclusion: The data suggests that Metascore (expert reviews) has a limited impact on predicting domestic box office performance. High Metascores do not necessarily guarantee higher box office returns, indicating that other factors, such as marketing, genre, or timing, might play a larger role in determining a movieâ€™s financial success.
